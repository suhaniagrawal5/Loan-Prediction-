Loan Prediction Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on loan approval prediction using a given dataset.
The objective is to analyze applicant data and predict whether a loan is likely to be approved or not based on various features.
While the model accuracy is not optimal, this project represents an important learning step in understanding machine learning workflows, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. The emphasis of this project is on learning and experimentation, rather than achieving perfect performance.

🎯 Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to evaluate loan applications efficiently to reduce risk.
The goal of this project is to:
Analyze historical loan data.
Preprocess and clean the dataset.
Train a machine learning model to predict loan approval status.
